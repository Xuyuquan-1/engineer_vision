[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcamera_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "camera_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    camera_interfaceConfig.cmake
    camera_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "camera_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "camera_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "camera_interface" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
