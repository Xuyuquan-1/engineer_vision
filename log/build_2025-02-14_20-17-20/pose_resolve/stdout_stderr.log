[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findserial_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "serial_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "serial_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    serial_interfaceConfig.cmake
    serial_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "serial_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "serial_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "serial_interface" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
